# HuffmanAlgorithm
Huffman coding was the state of the art in compression in the 1950s and at the time it was considered a breakthrough. Itâ€™s a greedy algorithm and interesting DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS 2 Figure 1: The general schematics of a compression algorithm. The original data is run through an encoder and a compressed file is generated. The compressed data should be smaller than the original data and it includes enough information to allow for the data to be run through a decoder. In a lossless algorithm, the decompressed data should be the same as the original data.
